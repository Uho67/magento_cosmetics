 * incoming shipping AddressInterface before core persists or validates it (docs §6 B3).
 *
 * Both Magento\Checkout\Model\ShippingInformationManagement::saveAddressInformation() and
 * Magento\Quote\Model\ShippingAddressManagement::assign() eventually merge the mutated address
 * into the real quote address entity via `$quoteAddress->addData($address->getData())` (see
 * Magento\Quote\Model\Quote::setShippingAddress()). That is a flat-array copy of `_data`: it does
 * NOT unpack `extension_attributes` into columns. So the composed values are applied here as
 * plain setData() keys — which do survive that merge, the resource model save, and the
 * fieldset.xml quote-to-order copy — rather than only as extension attributes.
